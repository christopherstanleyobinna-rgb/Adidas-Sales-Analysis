# 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes Adidas’ sales performance across time, regions, products, retailers, and sales channels. The goal is to uncover insights into sales growth, profitability, and customer behavior, and provide recommendations for improving business performance.

# ⚙️ Tools & Technologies

- Power BI → For building interactive dashboards and data visualizations.

- Excel/CSV → Data source cleaning and preparation.

- GitHub → For project documentation and sharing.

# ❓ Why Power BI Instead of Python?

Although the internship project guideline suggested Python, I selected Power BI for this phase of analysis because:

-  I had not yet fully learned Python for data analysis and visualization.

- Power BI allowed me to quickly clean, transform, and visualize data in an interactive way.

- The project focus was on business insights, and Power BI dashboards are effective for presenting them clearly.

- Power BI supports real-time visual storytelling, which is ideal for management-level presentations.

👉 Python remains a tool I intend to learn and apply in future projects, but Power BI was the most practical choice for this internship task.
